                    <p>It’s at Ribeaupierre Highschool from Ribeauvillé that I obtained my highschool diploma, a beautiful scool that took residence in the ruins of the Ribeaupierre family’s castle on the summit of the city.</p>
                    <p>Here, I have studied in what used to be the «Social Economics» path which gave particular importance to various knowledge about the way the economy works or how a society is organised.</p>

                    <h1>Business Studies</h1>
                    <p>After highschool, like many young adults, I didn’t have a particular professionnal field which I wanted to aim for. So, I decided I’d work towards a Business Degree in order to give myself skills which would be useful no matter where I end up.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I did, at Colmar’s IUT, a two-year degree in Commercialisation Techniques in order to acquire general skills in various fields of business. I have also completed the third year of a licence at the FMA to specialise in marketing.</p>

                    <h1>BUT Network and Telecommunications</h1>
                    <p>After those 3 years in business, here I am in a field that is all about electronics and computers. To be completely honest, I have always been really interested by computers, whether it be what we can do with them or how they internally work.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to various acquaintances working in the field, I could take notice of the professional potential of this field of work, something I hadn’t really considered before. Which isn’t necessarily bad, since I can now evolve in a subject that I’m really passionate about while having a few very useful skills.</p>
